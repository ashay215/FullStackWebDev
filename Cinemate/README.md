Cinemate is a full-stack application that is essentially a mashup of Facebook and IMDB; it is a social network built around movies.
Users can log in, sign up, follow and unfollow others, search for movies and other users, and interact with the movie pages.
Data persistence is achieved through XML files and parsing via the Java DOM package; this application was built entirely from scratch.
The later versions also use MySQL and calls to the TMDB and OMDB APIs.
