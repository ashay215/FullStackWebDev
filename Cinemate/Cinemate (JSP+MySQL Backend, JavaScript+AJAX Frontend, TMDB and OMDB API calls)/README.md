I have provided both my folders and the .zip file of my project. The source code is the same in both, and seems to be working once redownloaded, but I think the .zip is a safer bet for my code, and would probably be the best option for grading.

CSS is not perfect.

My config.txt file is in my src/backend folder; I was told I would not be docked for doing this.
API calls are handled in my Movie class.

Have absolutely no idea why events do not show up in feed - they are entered into the database through ajax. However, if events are entered via SQL code in the SQL file, they show up in the feed, with the same IDENTICAL syntax. SQL bug?
