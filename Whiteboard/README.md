This is a group project that I worked on with three others as part of a Software Development class project.
We chose to make a web app that would allow users to interact with other students in their classes. Some of
the features include file sharing, a forum to ask questions in, chatting with other in your class,
and a shared whiteboard to allow users to work on homework problems or draw diagrams on.
More functionality is elaborated in the documentation.

Extensive software development documentation can be found in the folder SoftwareDocuments. 
This includes the intial project proposal, high-level requirements, deployment documentation,
technical specifications, a detailed design(with database schema, inheritance diagrams,
mockup screenshots, etc.), and error testing documentation. 

The project backend is in Java , with a MySQL database; the frontend uses HTML/CSS, JavaScript/AJAX in JSP files.
AJAX calls are handled by Java Servlets, and networking is achieved through WebSockets.
